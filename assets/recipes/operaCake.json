If you want to be accurate and weigh the dough, each half should be around or a little more than 12 ounces each. On a floured work surface using floured hands, pat each into a small rectangle. Then, using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll each portion of dough out into a 10&#215;8 inch rectangle. It should be about 1/4&#8243; thick. As you&#8217;re rolling, use your hands to help keep the sides straight as you see me do in the video. Spread half of the melted butter onto each rectangle&#8211; doesn&#8217;t need to be exactly half, just eyeball it. It will be a thick layer of butter. Mix the brown sugar, pumpkin pie spice, and cinnamon together then sprinkle evenly over each.

As other reviewers have suggested, it is a fussy one but worth the effort for the ooooos and ahhhhs. \r\nI rolled the dough out on my silicone mats and used it to help roll them up. Made the process so much easier for me. I did have to adjust the shape of the cookies after cutting because the log settled into an oval in the fridge. The fact that they were oval wasn't a big deal but I wanted the look for the photo submission. I prefer the thicker cut, better for dunking in my morning coffee! \r\nI did hope for a more pronounced pumpkin flavor but they were still good. I made the mint chocolate checkerboard cookies as well and those were my favorite of the two. More challenging, more impressive, and more flavorful. \r\nThese recipes were enjoyed by many and I received lots of compliments (along with one \"that's just wayyy too much work\" haha!)."},{"@type":"Review","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"4"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Kristin Miles"},"datePublished":"2021-10-30","reviewBody":"These were finicky but in the end turned out great."},{"@type":"Review","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Lauren"},"datePublished":"2021-10-30","reviewBody":"Wow, these are so good!

I've never made roll cookies before, but these intrigued me.  I'm very happy I took the chance.  These cookies were delicious!  I loved the cinnamon/pumpkin spice flavor.  My family opted for the maple icing, which was amazing (tasted like maple candy).  Only issue I had was the rolling part.  I think I needed to flour my counter more as the dough was sticking.  I worked it slowly and pinched places where it pulled apart and they came out fine.  The family voted and wants more next time I have extra pumpkin.

A couple of other ideas.  I used a very fine strainer to remove the moisture of the pumpkin, pressing down on the pumpkin with a spoon.  I let the dough sit in the fridge for about 15 minutes before rolling so it was easier to roll.
