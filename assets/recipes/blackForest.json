Add egg whites.

Set aside.","url":"https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/french-macarons/#instruction-step-2"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Add cream of tartar and extract (if using) to egg whites. Using a handheld mixer or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat together on medium speed until very soft peaks form. This takes a few minutes of beating. At first the egg white and cream of tartar mixture will be foamy, then the bubbles will begin to tighten and the beaters will leave tracks as the egg whites build volume. Once they begin leaving tracks, you likely have soft peaks. Stop beating. Add about 1/3 of the superfine sugar. Beat on medium-high speed for 5 seconds, then with the mixer continuing to run, add another 1/3 of the sugar. Beat for 5 seconds, then with the mixer continuing to run, add the remaining sugar. Beat on medium-high speed until stiff glossy peaks form. (This means the whites have stiff, smooth, and sharp points in the bowl or on the lifted whisk attachment/beaters. Stiff peaks do not droop down. You can turn the bowl upside down and the egg whites will not move or spill out.)\u00a0Using a rubber spatula, slowly and gently fold the food coloring (if using) into the egg whites.","url":"https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/french-macarons/#instruction-step-3"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Sift the almond flour and confectioners&#8217; sugar together in a large glass or metal mixing bowl. Use a spoon to help work any larger pieces through the sieve. You don&#8217;t want to discard a lot of that because then you won&#8217;t have enough dry ingredients in the batter.","url":"https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/french-macarons/#instruction-step-4"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Slowly fold the beaten egg whites into the almond flour mixture in 3 separate additions, folding until combined before adding the next addition. After you add all of the egg whites, pay very close attention to the consistency of your macaron batter. Continue folding the batter (which deflates air) until it thins out into the consistency of honey. What&#8217;s a more helpful cue is the figure 8 test. Drop the macaron batter off of your spatula in the form of a figure 8. The figure 8 should take no more than 10 seconds to sink back into itself. If it takes less, your batter was overmixed and is too thin. If it takes longer, continue slowly folding the batter to deflate more air, then perform the figure 8 test again. It&#8217;s best to go very slow so you don&#8217;t accidentally overmix.","url":"https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/french-macarons/#instruction-step-5"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Spoon the macaron batter into a piping bag fitted with a medium round piping tip, such as Wilton 12, Wilton 1A, or even Ateco 806. The macaron batter is very drippy, so transferring to the piping bag can be messy.","url":"https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/french-macarons/#instruction-step-6"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Holding the piping bag at a 90 degree angle over the baking sheet, pipe batter in 1.5 &#8211; 2 inch rounds about 1-2 inches apart on prepared baking sheets. I usually pipe little mounds&#8211; see video tutorial above. The piped macaron batter flattens out. Bang the pan a couple times on the counter to pop any air bubbles, then use a toothpick to pop any remaining air bubbles.","url":"https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/french-macarons/#instruction-step-7"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Let the piped macarons sit out until they are dry and no longer tacky on top, usually 30-60 minutes. This time allows the top to firm up and form a skin, which helps the macarons rise UP and form their trademark ruffly &#8220;feet.&#8221; Do not let them sit out for longer than they need to because they could begin to deflate.","url":"https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/french-macarons/#instruction-step-8"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 325\u00b0F (163\u00b0C).","url":"https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/french-macarons/#instruction-step-9"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Bake for 13 minutes. As the macaron shells bake, they should form feet. To test for doneness, lightly touch the top of a macaron with a spoon or your finger (careful, it&#8217;s hot). If the macaron seems wobbly, it&#8217;s not done and needs another 1-2 minutes. If it seems set, it&#8217;s done. Basically, bake until the macarons don&#8217;t move around when touched.","url":"https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/french-macarons/#instruction-step-10"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Let the shells cool on the baking sheet for 15 minutes, then transfer to a cooling rack to continue cooling.

They were still good but they needed a little bit longer, even though the shell was crispy. For the second batch, I made the Chocolate Peanut Butter Macarons and I cooked them at 300 and they turned out perfectly! I filled them all with whipped cream and chocolate.
